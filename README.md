# Spring Project using GraphQL

Just an example project with Spring as backend using GraphQL.

## Getting Started

Clone this project:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/SpringGraphQL.git
```

Open your Eclipse IDE and run this project as Spring boot App. If you don't know how, watch the following steps of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvzGf0cAlg4
* Install last JDK LTS.
* Install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.
* Configure your Eclipse IDE with your JDK.
* Install STS (Spring Tool Suite from Pivotal Company).
* Install MySQL Workbench.
* Import the db_bicycles_gql.sql file of this project in your MySQL Server.
* Configure your connection to MySQL editing user/password in the file application.properties of this project.

Once you have followed all the steps above, run the project as Spring Boot App.

If everything went well you can now try your backend using GraphiQL accessing through a web browser as you can see in the images below:

You can also query from Postman if you prefer:

## Built With

* [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/) - Install it if you want to edit this project backend with Eclipse IDE.
* [Spring Tools Suite](https://spring.io/tools) - Install the plugin in Eclipse IDE.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
* [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) - A tool that helps you structure GraphQL queries correctly.
